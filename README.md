## Fancy seeing you here! 👀 

I'm Vanessa, a software engineer with a background in **marketing and sales** who recently graduated from BrainStation Bootcamp. During the program, I developed skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js**.  

🚀 I just finished my first **full-stack application** to help a friend grow her small business. Check out my repositories (**tumbling-goat**)! My next steps include implementing:  
```
✅ MySQL database for persistent storage  
✅ User authentication for secure access  
✅ Secure payment option to support business transactions  
```

🌱 Currently learning **PHP & Ruby on Rails** to expand my skill set and take on new challenges in web development.  

💡 My background in **marketing and sales** gives me a unique perspective on user experience, business growth, and data-driven decision-making.  

🚴‍♀️ Outside of coding, I'm passionate about **cycling, yoga, and all things outdoors**—whether it’s exploring trails, paddleboarding, or just enjoying the fresh air!
